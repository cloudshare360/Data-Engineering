If someone wants to learn data engineering and include Snowflake and Databricks in the process, here’s a recommended learning order that builds foundational knowledge before diving into specific platforms:

⸻

Recommended Learning Path:

1. Core Data Engineering Concepts (First)
	•	Data modeling (star/snowflake schemas)
	•	ETL vs ELT processes
	•	Data warehouses vs data lakes
	•	Batch vs streaming data
	•	SQL proficiency (essential!)
	•	Basics of distributed systems (optional but helpful)

2. Python and SQL (Simultaneous)
	•	Learn Python for scripting, data transformation, and pipeline development.
	•	Strengthen SQL skills for querying and transforming data.

3. Cloud Fundamentals (Optional but Beneficial)
	•	Basic knowledge of cloud services (AWS/GCP/Azure)
	•	Storage services (S3, Azure Blob, GCS)
	•	Compute services (EC2, Lambda, etc.)

4. Learn Databricks (First Platform)
	•	Why: Databricks introduces you to data lakes, big data processing with Spark, and notebook-style development.
	•	Focus:
	•	Apache Spark (core component)
	•	Delta Lake
	•	DataFrames & PySpark
	•	Structured Streaming
	•	Notebooks and job workflows
	•	Integration with cloud storage (e.g., S3)

5. Learn Snowflake (Second Platform)
	•	Why: Snowflake is a cloud-native data warehouse focused on scalable analytics and SQL-based transformations.
	•	Focus:
	•	Snowflake architecture (separation

If someone wants to learn data engineering and include both Snowflake and Databricks, here is the ideal order to follow:

⸻

1. Core Data Engineering Fundamentals (First)

Before tools, understand the principles:
	•	ETL/ELT processes
	•	Data modeling (star/snowflake schema)
	•	Data warehousing vs data lakes
	•	Batch vs streaming
	•	SQL (must-have)
	•	Python (highly recommended)

⸻

2. Learn Databricks (First Tool)

Why first?
Databricks teaches you how to work with big data processing and transformation using Apache Spark, which is a foundational skill in modern data engineering.

Topics to focus:
	•	PySpark and DataFrames
	•	Delta Lake (data lakehouse architecture)
	•	Notebooks and job orchestration
	•	Connecting to cloud storage (S3, ADLS, etc.)
	•	Streaming with Structured Streaming

⸻

3. Learn Snowflake (Second Tool)

Why second?
Snowflake focuses on data warehousing and analytics, and is great for SQL-based processing once data is cleaned and loaded—often the step after raw processing.

Topics to focus:
	•	Virtual warehouses & compute separation
	•	Data loading and unloading
	•	SQL transformations (ELT)
	•	Time travel, cloning, and data sharing
	•	Integration with tools like dbt or Airflow

⸻

4. Orchestration & Real-World Projects

After learning both platforms:
	•	Use tools like Airflow or dbt to orchestrate workflows
	•	Build end-to-end pipelines: Ingest (Databricks) → Store (Delta/S3) → Load into Snowflake → Transform with dbt

⸻

Summary Order:
	1.	Data Engineering Fundamentals
	2.	Python + SQL
	3.	Databricks (processing layer)
	4.	Snowflake (storage & analytics layer)
	5.	Workflow orchestration + Projects
